# Intrinsic Value Calculator

## Overview

The Intrinsic Value Calculator is a tool designed to estimate the true worth of a stock based on its underlying fundamentals. It provides a calculated value of a company's shares independent of its current market price by considering earnings, growth potential, and other financial metrics.

## Key Metrics

### Earnings Per Share (EPS)

**Definition:** EPS stands for "Earnings Per Share." It measures a company's profitability and performance by dividing net earnings by the number of outstanding shares of common stock.

**Formula:**
EPS = (Net Earnings - Preferred Dividends) / Average Outstanding Shares


- **Net Earnings:** Total profits after deducting taxes, interest expenses, and other costs.
- **Preferred Dividends:** Dividends paid to preferred shareholders, if applicable.
- **Average Outstanding Shares:** Average number of shares of common stock outstanding during a specific period.

### Price-to-Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio)

**Definition:** The PE Ratio, or Price-to-Earnings Ratio, assesses the valuation of a company's stock. It is calculated by dividing the market price per share by its earnings per share (EPS).

**Formula:**
PE Ratio = Market Price per Share / Earnings per Share (EPS)


- **Market Price per Share:** Current trading price of the stock.
- **Earnings per Share (EPS):** See above for calculation.

### Growth Rate

**Definition:** The Growth Rate refers to the rate at which a specific variable, such as revenue or earnings, increases or decreases over a period. It measures the pace of expansion or contraction in a business or economy.

**Formula:**
Growth Rate = ((Ending Value - Starting Value) / Starting Value) * 100



- **Ending Value:** The value of the variable at the end of the period.
- **Starting Value:** The value of the variable at the beginning of the period.

### Discount Rate

**Definition:** The Discount Rate is used to determine the present value of future cash flows. It reflects the time value of money, indicating that future cash flows are worth less today due to their potential earning capacity.

**Application:** The discount rate is used in investment appraisal and valuation models to adjust future cash flows to their present value.

## Example Calculation

Using the following data:

- **Stock Ticker:** AAPL
- **EPS:** 11.89
- **PE Ratio:** 15.04
- **Growth Rate (Next 5 Years per Annum):** 9.86%
- **Discount Rate:** 9.82%
- **Current Stock Value:** (To be calculated using the intrinsic value formula)

The intrinsic value of the stock can be determined based on these inputs, which helps investors assess whether a stock is overvalued, undervalued, or fairly priced relative to its current market value.

## How to Use

1. **Input the stock's EPS, PE Ratio, Growth Rate, and Discount Rate into the calculator.**
2. **The calculator will estimate the intrinsic value of the stock based on these inputs.**
3. **Compare the calculated intrinsic value to the current stock value to make informed investment decisions.**

## Notes

- The intrinsic value is an estimate and may vary based on changes in financial metrics and market conditions.
- Regular updates to the EPS, PE Ratio, Growth Rate, and Discount Rate are recommended for accurate calculations.
